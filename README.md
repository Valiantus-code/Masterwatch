<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

[![Masterwatch Screen Shot][game-screenshot]](https://github.com/VoR-gamedev/Masterwatch/tree/master/GitHub/images/screenshot.png)

This game was started because it reminds me of an old browser-based game and I had a hinkering to do some programming.

### Built With

* ![Nuget](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/MonoGame.Framework.DesktopGL?label=MonoGame.DesktopGL&style=plastic)

2. Clone this repository.
3. Run the Masterwatch.sln file located at the root directory.
4. The project should open in VS.
5. Add prerequisites to VS studio or your IDE of choice *(Explained below)*.

### Prerequisites (TBD)

These are the required libraries / frameworks for the project.
